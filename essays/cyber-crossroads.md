Being an indecisive person as I am, making big life choices is really hard. It puts a lot of stress on me and makes me doubt myself a lot of times, even in hindsight. It’s a hard trait that I have trouble overcoming, but I’ve learned just to accept everything and have fun in life, even if it doesn’t go the way that I want to. Go with the ebb and flow and live life to the fullest but I still have one of the biggest crossroads in my life ahead of me that I am running out of time deciding on.

## The Cyber Crossroad
	One of the biggest career decisions that I have been contemplating on is either going down the route of cyber security or software development. I have had experience with both and had fun learning about both topics but I am unsure on what path I should take. I have had this decision looming in the background for 6 years now, starting in my freshman year of high school when I took both my first cybersecurity and computer programming classes. I will try to dissect my thoughts on both fields.

## Cybersecurity
	Cyber security in general is really fun for me. I enjoy pentesting, reverse engineering different types of programs and malware, and just problem solving in general. The most fun competitions in my opinion are Capture the Flag competitions which give a lot of relative experience to the cyber security field. You can also get a really stable career in this field as well since security is on the rise, especially on the federal and state level. The drawbacks for me are the investment needed, especially the certifications. You would be spending thousands of dollars on different certifications like CompTIA, Cisco, and others just to help stand out in the field. Another thing is the immense fast pace of the real world and how fast vulnerabilities and day zeroes are created. Just keeping up with the amount of news that comes out can be very exhausting and stressful especially if you have to protect a lot of confidential information that could potentially be very harmful if the wrong hands get in on it. 

## Software Development
	Software development is very interesting to me as well. I do enjoy creating applications and little shortcuts that help make my daily life a lot easier and also enjoy seeing what other people can create just by typing some code. There is a lot of opportunities that are just waiting for some code to help push it and make you a lot of money with the right people. That is the main issue for me in this field, intense competition. I personally feel like the software engineering field is oversaturated with people since it is the new hot trend that a lot of companies are looking for and people are willing to pay top dollar for the best and those people pay top dollar to look like the best. It can be very intimidating and exhausting if you aren’t looking in the right places for help but I think working at a FAANG company is very overrated.

## What to do…
	I think the best thing to do is just go with the flow. I still have some time to make some projects that help me stand out and prepare myself for when the right time comes. The most important thing for me is to make sure that I am happy in what I do. Happiness and living a stable life will always be a bigger priority for me in everything that I do in the future and that is what I think life should always be about. In the meantime, I will try to experience the most out of life and work for the best life I can achieve.
