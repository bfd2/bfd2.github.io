*Oh My JavaScript*

### Diving In
	
 When I took my first higher level computer science class called ICS 314, one of the first topics that we learned about was JavaScript. At first, I thought it was just Java but just client-sided and more suitable for browsers and web pages. But I was so wrong. Really wrong. From my first impressions and my first-hand experience with the language, I have to say, it is one of the more fun languages that I have learned so far.

### Learning the Basics
	
 Learning the basics of JavaScript was pretty simple. I have seen it before when I did a lot of CTF competitions where I had to decode the JavaScript code in order to find the flag so I knew the basic structure of it and what it does. For this, I decided to do the FreeCodeCamp which contains around ~150 exercises that teaches you the basics of JavaScript and many other languages. What I didn’t know is how versatile it is with the ability to use functions in many different ways. Compared to Java, it is very good and it allows you to code more flexibly without the need to worry about semantics and valid data types. The strict comparison === was another new thing I learned that is very useful and I wish that other languages have (and that they probably do have.) What I didn’t know was that it is not only JavaScript. There is also a thing called ES6.

### Extensive Scripting (6)
	
 Learning about ECMAScript, or ES6 for short, was a massive obstacle for me. Firstly, the arrow functions are useful but very confusing when I first started using them. Then came destructing assignments and concise declarations and I felt like I was living in another world. The different structures were very confusing and convoluted but I can see how they are useful in calling different objects and functions, making the code very easy to read and manipulate. The concept of promises and setters/getters look very intriguing as well and I am very excited to use those concepts in upcoming projects.

Overall, the language looks very interesting and really fun to use unless you’re trying to combine it with HTML and CSS. Other than that, I am impressed with how it works. If you haven’t, you should definitely give it a shot as there is a lot of free resources out there that will help you start on the right foot.
