## The Problem
Currently, there is no way to track current problems or new problems emerging on the UH Manoa Campus. We can only rely on the newsletters from the administrators and campus staff. 

## The Solution
Introducing, UHPetition, a petition website that tracks current issues on the UH Campus. Students and staff can log onto the website, sign petitions to problems that they care about, and comments their thoughts on how it has affected them or how it can be fixed. Once it reaches a certain number of signers, it gets sent to the Dean or another higher up.

## Mockup Ideas
Users: Have access to the main page, showing the petitions they wrote and currently trending petitions. They can also sort by new or popular petitions.

Admins: Have access to the database of petitions on the website, can delete inappropriate/offensive petitions, moderate comments, ban users from the website.
