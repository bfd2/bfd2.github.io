## The Problem
Currently, there is no way to track current problems or new problems emerging on the UH Manoa Campus. We can only rely on the newsletters from the administrators and campus staff. 

## The Solution
Introducing, UHPetition, a petition website that tracks current issues on the UH Campus. Students and staff can log onto the website, sign petitions to problems that they care about, and comments their thoughts on how it has affected them or how it can be fixed.
