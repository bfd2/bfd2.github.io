## The Problem
Currently, there is no way to track current problems or new problems emerging on the UH Manoa Campus. We can only rely on the newsletters from the administrators and campus staff or by word of mouth.

## The Solution
Introducing, UHPetition, a petition website that tracks current issues on the UH Campus. Students and staff can log onto the website, sign petitions to problems that they care about, and comments their thoughts on how it has affected them or how it can be fixed. Once it reaches a certain number of signers, it gets sent to the Provost or another higher up.

## Mockup Ideas
It is similar to the White House petition website, or change.org.

- To prevent harassment and facilitate civil discussion, all comments and petitions posted are using their real name provided by UH.

Users: Have access to the main page, showing the petitions they wrote and currently trending petitions. They can also sort by new or popular petitions.

Admins: Have access to the database of petitions on the website, can delete inappropriate/offensive petitions, moderate comments, ban users from the website.

Each petition page will contain:
- A photo
- Title and description of the issue
- Number of people signed
- A button to sign the petition
- Comment section

Some ideas for pages include:
- Petition page
- Signature page (Sign + Comment if necessary)
- Home page
- Admin page
- Login page

## Use Case Ideas
- New user goes to the landing page, logs in, creates a new profile, goes to home page, learns how to use the website.
- User goes to the landing page, logs in, goes to the home page, creates a new petition or signs a petition with/without a comment.
- Admin goes to the landing page, logs in, goes to the home page, moderates current petitions and comments.

## Beyond the Basics
Potential advanced features that can be added in the future:
- Status updates if the Provost/Dean has seen/addressed it.
- A filter to sort by different campuses.
- Clicking user's profile to see the petitions they have made.
