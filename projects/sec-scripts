summary: "A series of scripts developed to secure various operating systems."

These are a series of scripts that me and my team developed for the CyberPatriot cyber security competition. The main objective of the CyberPatriot competition is to secure and patch as many vulnerabilities on various operating systems in the alloted 6 hours you are given. It did a variety of things like securing and disabling ports, checking for false registry values, installing and using free and secure anti-malware software, and securing system config files amongst other things done to secure points in the competition. We wrote in shell for securing Ubuntu, Debian, and other Linux-based machines, and Visual Basic (VSB) for Windows Server, 8, and 10. Due to competition rules, I cannot share the code nor the UI used in the script.
