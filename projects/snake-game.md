This is my take on the classic game of Snake that I made for my AP Computer Science class back in high school. It is just like a regular game of Snake except that each time you collect 5 pellets, the speed of the snake slightly increases. The body of the snake also changes color each time you collect a pellet and makes it into a rainbow snake. 

This is one of my first ever Computer Science projects and it holds a special place in my heart because it is the one that got me hooked into Computer Science.
