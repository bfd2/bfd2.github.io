summary: "A Discord Bot that displayed the scores of teams in the CyberPatriot cyber security competition."
---

I created a Discord bot that displayed the scores of my school's teams that participated in the CyberPatriot cyber security competition. CyberPatriot is a national high school cyber security where the goal is to find all the vulnerabilities on various different operating systems like Windows and Debian, and secure them to gain points. 

My bot would scrape the official leaderboard and format them for each team. It showed the division, number of points and vulnerabilities per operating system that each team fixed, and where they place in their division. It would try to update as soon as someone used the command in the server and show when the leaderboard was updated at the bottom of the prompt.

The bot is named after my favorite high school teacher, Mr. Salter. He is the one that got me started on my computer science journey.
